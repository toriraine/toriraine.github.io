			<p class="info1"> Bees are important to our environment in sustaining the nature around us. They aide in pollinating floral and plant-based ecosystems to help them grow, reproduce and create food. They are not only necessary in making honey. Without bees, there would be limited growth in our natural environment, with less beauty and less oxygen. This is why all types of bees are essential to our world. </p>

			<p class="info2"> As we know it, the polar ice caps are experiencing ice-albedo feedback. This consists of the ice that is melting, now exposing uncovered land. This land now absorbs more sunlight and is increasing the rate of melting due to surrounding heat. This, in turn, is changing atmospheric patterns and feeding a never-ending loop of melting. Prevention is the least we can do for our polar bears. </p>

			<p class="info3"> World pollution continues to be a horrible struggle amongst humans. Plastics specifically range up to about 8 million pieces floating among the earth's oceans. The garbage and remnants of the water brings in about 60% plastics to 40% actual ocean debris. This pollution also effects ourselves, and their chemicals are directly linked to cancer, birth defects, and many other horrible bodily issues. </p>
